## 仇뉴bout / Problem Statement
Problem Statement  
In today's interconnected world, social media have become central to our communication and our means of self-expression. However, this also gives rise to cyberbullying which can affect individuals mental health and well-being. Our motivation is to cultivate a safer online environment.

Aim: Detect & classify offensive or abusive language in tweets as cyberbullying using machine learning algorithms

Objective:  
游릭 Build a cyberbullying tweet detection model capable of identifying cyberbullying tweets  
游릭 Classify tweets based on demographic attributes such as age, etc to enhance detection  
游릭 Gain insights on the demographics that is most affected by online harrassment  
游릭 Optimize our model by employing machine learning algorithms to train & fine-tune our model  

Possibilities that this insights can be beneficial for:  
游릭 Protecting individuals mental health and well-being on social media  
游릭 Aiding social media platorms in implementing and upholding their community standards with regards to cyberbullying
