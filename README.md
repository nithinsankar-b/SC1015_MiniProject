## ❓About / Problem Statement
Problem Statement  
> In today's interconnected world, social media have become central to our communication and our means of self-expression. However, this also gives rise to cyberbullying which can affect individuals mental health and well-being. Our motivation is to cultivate a safer online environment.

Aim: Detect & classify offensive or abusive language in tweets as cyberbullying using machine learning algorithms

Objective:  
🟢 Build a cyberbullying tweet detection model capable of identifying cyberbullying tweets  
🟢 Classify tweets based on demographic attributes such as age, etc to enhance detection  
🟢 Gain insights on the demographics that is most affected by online harrassment  
🟢 Optimize our model by employing machine learning algorithms to train & fine-tune our model  

Possibilities that this insights can be beneficial for:  
🟢 Protecting individuals mental health and well-being on social media  
🟢 Aiding social media platorms in implementing and upholding their community standards with regards to cyberbullying

## <a id = "analysis">🔬 Exploratory Analysis</a> 
[Back to `Main` Content Page](#repository)  
  
To analyse and visualze the data we have cleaned to understand its underlying patterns, relationships and anomalies. We would be using data visualization techniques in hopes of generating insights that could help us better understand the data before applying any models or conducting any hypothesis testing.
### <a id = "number">🔢 Number Game</a>
> The "numbers game" is used in our exploratory data analysis where we systematically examined numerical data to identify patterns, trends and anmoalies.
> Here, we plot the number of tweets belonging to each category in the dataset as well as their relative percentages.  

### <a id = "token">🪙 Tokenization</a>
> Here, we used tokenization to break down a piece of text like sentences or paragraphs into individual worlds or "tokens".
> From this plot, we can see the most common words in the tweets of our data.
  
### <a id = "word">🔠 Word Cloud</a>
> For this section, we used a WordCloud to present the most commonly seen words according to each **classified** category.
> The presence of each words in a tweet will increase its corresponding probability towards being classified into its respective category.

#### Word Cloud was generated for the following 
> - Gender Categories 
> - Religion Categories  
> - Age Categories  
> - Ethnicity Categories  
> - Other Cyberbullying Categories 
> - Not Cyberbullying Related    

### <a id = "sentiment">📈 Sentiment Analysis</a>
> - For sentiment analysis, we used the the module TextBlob for natural language processing tasks. The sentiment analysis model considers various factors such as word polarity, intensity of sentiment, and context to determine the sentiment score for a given text.  
> - This would help us in identifying sentiments - positive (➕), negative (➖), neutral; from a piece of text.
    
The sentiment score represents the polarity of the text (Positive, Negative, Neutral). It is a floating point number ranging from -1.0 to +1.0.  
> - If the sentiment score is close to 1.0, it indicates a very positive sentiment.  
> - If the sentiment score is close to -1.0, it indicates a very negative sentiment.  
> - If the sentiment score is around 0.0, it indicates a neutral sentiment.  

## <a id = "machine">🤖 Machine Learning</a>
[Back to `Main` Content Page](#repository)  
  
We used algorithms and statistical models that allow us to learn from our data and make any predicitons or decisions without explicitly programming it. It helps us identify patterns across our large datasets efficiently.

#### 📇 Results for each model are:
Statistical Results  
> - Shows a classification report on:
>   - Precision
>   - Recall
>   - f1-score
>   - Support
>   - Accuracy
>   - Macro average
>   - Weighted average 

Confusion Matrix  
> Shows the matrix of true vs predicted for each category    
  
ROC Curve
> - We included this ROC curve to illustrate the balance between true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) across different thresholds.
> - A model excels when its curve hugs the top-left corner, indicating high TPR and low FPR. Conversely, a curve closer to the diagonal line signifies poor ability to discriminate, no better than random chance.
  
Learning Curve
> A learning curve is a plot that shows how a model's performance, often measured by accuracy, changes as the size of the training dataset increases. It helps assess if the model benefits from more data and can reveal issues like overfitting or underfitting. Cross-validation scores are often included for a more reliable estimate of performance.

### <a id = "naive"> 1️⃣ Naive Bayes</a>
 
- It is a classificaiton algorithm that assumes all predictors are independent of one another.  
- Naive Bayes Model is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm used for NLP applications like text classification tasks, particularly in natural language processing (NLP). It's based on Bayes' theorem with the "naive" assumption of feature independence. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes often performs well in practice. In our classification, it performs moderately accurate.
  
### <a id = "logistic"> 2️⃣ Multinomial Logistic Regression</a>
  
- Multinomial Logistic Regression extends Logistic Regression to handle multi-class classification tasks.  
- This is done by predicting probabilities for each class and selecting the class with the highest probability as the predicted output. 
  
### <a id = "support"> 3️⃣ Support Vector Machine</a>
    
- SVM classification finds the best hyperplane to separate data into different classes, maximizing the margin between them.  
- It's effective for various classification tasks due to its ability to handle linear and non-linear separations through kernel functions.  
  
### <a id = "random"> 4️⃣ Random Forrest Classifier</a>
      
- Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble learning technique for classification tasks.  
- It builds multiple decision trees and outputs the mode of the classes predicted by individual trees.  
- It's effective, versatile, and resistant to overfitting.tions through kernel functions.   
  
### <a id = "bert"> 5️⃣ Bi-LSTM</a>
    
- Also known as Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory.    
- A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that consists of 2 LSTM layers - processing in forward and backward directions.

## <a id = "challenges"> 😢 Challenges Faced</a>
[Back to `Main` Content Page](#repository)  
  
> - This was our first machine learning project! So the learning curve was very steep, especially involving natural language proccessing w/ text data.  
> - We had to come up with unique exploratory data analysis that is relevant for our topic unlike conventional projects.  
> - We also faced a few issues in handling the installation of several of the packages used initially. We had to troubleshoot a few times at the start.  
> - Naturally working on such realistic projects that we did not have experience for results in a plethora of errors. The error handling was very time consuming.
